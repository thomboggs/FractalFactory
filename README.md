# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot/Julia Set Visualizer


## Instructions for running the project

## Overview of your code structure

## Rubric Satisfaction


## Current Vision Of Completed Project:
- Dual Frame app in a single window. 
- Left side shows Mandelbrot Set, Right side show the julia set at 0,0
- When you click on a chart, the orbit for the mandelbrot set at that coordinate is calculated and the julia set for that coefficient is displayed on the right. 

## Next Steps:
- Add concurrency to Julia Calculation
- update initial coordinates
- update coordinate calculations
- Update Memory management according to best practices
- Update display options. for intelligent coloring, brightness etc.
- Add description in the menu
- For Julia Calc, have a multistep render process for quick view and also detailed view (If concurrency not fast enough)
- Check Rubric to ensure that this meets specs. 
- Submit for Review
- Add Zoom feature to both
- add saving of output images
